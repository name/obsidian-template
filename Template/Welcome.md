This is your new *vault*.

I've put the font I like here [[commitmono-variablefont.ttf]].

New notes will be saved to 'notes/fleeting'. Once you're happy that the note has the information you want, move the note from 'notes/fleeting' to 'notes'.

Daily notes will be saved to 'notes/log'.

Templates are all under 'templates'.

Attachments will saved automatically under 'attachments'.

I've added some plugins that should make stuff easier in general, take a look through them in Settings > Community plugins.

Hotkeys:
* Ctrl+K: Finder - search and create notes
* Ctrl+P: Commands, there's tons, use them!
* Ctrl+J: Insert Template, then pick from anything under the 'templates' folder.

That is all, that's the workflow, make it your own!!
